# Statistics with R - Bachelor's degree practical work

This repository contains every pratical work I did in the stats course on my second year of bachelor's degree.<br> 
I used R with RStudio.

Every file is commented in french but easily translatable in english.

I did not include the wording because of copyrights, but the comments explain well the purpose of each exercise.

## Download R (and RStudio)

_Windows :_ <br>
First, you need to download the last version of R which can find [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).<br>
Then you can use the _Open Source_ version of [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) which provides great tools to learn how to use R.

_Linux (Ubuntu) :_ <br>
You can follow the instructions on the [Ubuntu wiki](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/r).
